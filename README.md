# Final_Paper_ML

## About
This is the Github repo for the code associated with the final project for our Neural Networks Class (CS 8321) which is a reaserch paper. 

The paper specifically is an explority study about potential circuits that could be found in Stable Diffusion models. 
To find these circuits we ran a gradient decent of the each of the filters of the Stable Diffusion model to identify
the minimally excitrory image and to visually analyze them.
